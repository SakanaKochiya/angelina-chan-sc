Because she can Block up to 3 enemies and shrug off their attacks fairly easily, she‚Äôs often one of the best Defenders for Doctors to raise early in their Arknights careers.\nBeing a 3* unit, Beagle can promote to E1, but not to E2, which limits her ability to keep up with higher-rarity Operators. She also has no way to mitigate enemy Arts damage, which becomes increasingly common in higher-end content. Despite this, Beagle remains useful for a surprisingly long time.

Between these two abilities, Spot supplements the frontline well: he can bottleneck enemies with his Block-2 (Block-3 after promoting), he has innate RES to stand up to enemy Casters, and when the chips are down he can function as an extra healer.\nSpot‚Äôs low rarity makes him easier to max out in Potential than higher-rarity Defenders, but unfortunately it also hampers his maximum power. As a 3* Operator, Spot can never promote to E2, limiting his stats and abilities. The unreliability of Physical Evasion is also an issue. Early players in particular may find good use for Spot, since his combination of tankiness, extra healing, lucky buffs, and accessibility can be a lifesaver when resources are limited.

Judicious use of this Skill can make Cardigan a decent option for tanking enemy Casters despite her lack of RES, as she can shrug off their Arts with a self-heal and keep face-tanking for a while longer.\nCardigan runs into problems when facing strong enemies that hit harder than her HP pool can handle. Her self-heal is great for sustain, but it doesn‚Äôt increase her ability to mitigate damage. Lacking an E2 promotion also limits Cardigan‚Äôs ability to contribute in the long term, and at present she is not available from Recruitment, which makes her a little less accessible than her 3* ranking would suggest\n\nStats(Elite 1 lvl 55, not include trust bonus and potential):\nHP: 2130\nAtk: 305\nDef: 475\nRes: 0\nDP: 18\nBlock: 3\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 1,2s\n\nRecommended skill: Regeneration Œ±(Skill 1)`)

It‚Äôs a simple effect, but very useful against high-DEF enemies.\nUnfortunately, when you try to please two clients equally, you run the risk of pleasing neither.

Although this may seem like it defeats the purpose of using an AoE Guard, Popukar has a comparable statline to her Archetype peers at Elite 1, making her as effective as a pure attacker at a much lower investment cost.\n\nStats(Elite 1 lvl 55, not include trust bonus and potential):\nHP: 1858\nAtk: 495\nDef: 245\nRes: 0\nDP: 19\nBlock: 2\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 1,2s\n\nRecommended skill: ATK Up Œ±(Skill 1)`)
